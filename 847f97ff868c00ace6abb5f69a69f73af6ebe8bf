!CAUTION! This commit seemed to cause me a very serious amount of trouble!

A moc file didn't compile. Even switching back didn't repair the situation.
The solution was cloning the repo freshly.

Then comparing the directories showed some additional .lib and (especially?) .exp files within the buggy dir. Erasing them and deleting and resetting CMake allowed a successful rebuild again.

I bet that's not the full truth.
